# moodle-booktool_github
This is a tool for the Moodle Book module. The aim is to allow the contents of a Book resource to be connected with a single file within a github repository. 

The aim is to allow the sharing of the content beyond a single Moodle course. Enabling sharing and potentially the collaborative authoring of the same content from another Moodle course, Moodle instance, or outside of Moodle entirely.

Initial development is part of the Moodle open book project - https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/research/the-moodle-open-book-module-project/

**Current Status**

Is basically working. Will push/pull content for a Moodle book from a github repository. 

The interface is ugly and incomplete.

*Requirements*

* GitHub account
* Repository
